/**
 * Provides a way to handle different types of state for providers that allow a state param.
 *
 * Some authentication protocols defines a state param which can be used to transport some
 * state to an authentication provider. The authentication provider sends this state back
 * to the application, after the authentication to the provider was granted.
 *
 * The state parameter can be used for different things. Silhouette provides two state handlers
 * out of the box. One state handler can transport additional user state to the provider. This
 * could be an URL were the user should be redirected after authentication to the provider, or
 * any other per-authentication based state. An other important state handler protects the
 * application for CSRF attacks.
