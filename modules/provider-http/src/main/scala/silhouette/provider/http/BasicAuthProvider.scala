/**
 * A request provider implementation which supports HTTP basic authentication.
 *
 * The provider supports the change of password hashing algorithms on the fly. Sometimes it may be possible to change
 * the hashing algorithm used by the application. But the hashes stored in the backing store can't be converted back
 * into plain text passwords, to hash them again with the new algorithm. So if a user successfully authenticates after
 * the application has changed the hashing algorithm, the provider hashes the entered password again with the new
 * algorithm and stores the auth info in the backing store.
 *
 * @param authInfoReader         A function that tries to find the [[silhouette.password.PasswordInfo]] for the given
 *                               [[LoginInfo]].
 * @param authInfoWriter         A function that writes the [[silhouette.password.PasswordInfo]] for the given
 *                               [[LoginInfo]].
 * @param identityReader         The reader to retrieve the [[Identity]] for the [[LoginInfo]].
 * @param passwordHasherRegistry The password hashers used by the application.
 * @param ec                     The execution context to handle the asynchronous operations.
 * @tparam R The type of the request.
