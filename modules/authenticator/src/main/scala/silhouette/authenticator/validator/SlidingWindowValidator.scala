 * A validator that checks if an [[Authenticator]] has timed out after a certain time if it hasn't been used.

 * after a certain time if it hasn't been used. So it checks if the time elapsed since the last time the
 * [[Authenticator]] was used, is longer than the maximum idle timeout specified as [[idleTimeout]] argument
 * of the validator.
